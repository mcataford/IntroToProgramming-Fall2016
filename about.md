# Hi!

My name is Marc, and I'll be your instructor for the semester. I'm a fourth-year computer engineering student with a passion for technology, sustainability, education and media. I've been giving private programming classes online and offline for a few years now, spreading the fun of building things with languages like PHP, Javascript, Java, C/C++, Python and a handful of others. I've also been teaching French grammar for the past seven years. Whether it is French or computer programming, it's all a matter of __syntax__.

I've been working as a web developer and editor at [The McGill Daily](www.mcgilldaily.com) for almost two years, and at [Graphite Publications](www.graphitepublications.com) for a few months; if you fancy writing and having an audience, don't hesitate to check them out. It's a great opportunity to learn new skills, or fine-tune the ones you already have.

This is the first course that I've given at SSMU Minicourses, and I've love to hear about what you'd like to learn, and how to teach you better. Please email me at [c.marcandre@gmail.com](mailto:c.marcandre@gmail.com) for _literally anything_ and it'll be my pleasure to reply back as soon as possible.

Cheers!

Marc
