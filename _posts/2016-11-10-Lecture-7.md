Now that we know about objects, control flow structures like for/while loops and if/if else/else blocks and the general use of variables, it's time to explore what Java provides to us to organize our data. So far, we've used _arrays_ a lot, but we also discussed that the array data structure was very limited because of its _fixed size_.

## Arraylist

The _ArrayList_ is a very important implementation of a classical data structure: the linked list. In practice, it expands on the idea of the array and, using objects, it allows us to have a _variable length_ array instead of a _fixed length_ one.

The ArrayList is part of the `java.util.ArrayList` package, which you need to _import_ by adding `import java.util.ArrayList;` at the top of the file in which you are using the list:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class MyClass {
//Code...
}

```

Similarly to what we've seen before with objects, we can initialize a new ArrayList by using the `new` keyword, but this time, we also need to specify the _type_ of what we want to store:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class MyClass {
  ArrayList<Integer> myList = new ArrayList<Integer>();
}

```

Here, we declare an ArrayList meant to contain variables of type Integer, which are simply a _wrapper_ (or object-version) for the primitive `int` type.

Notice that we do not need to specify a _length_ for our list: the length is incremented as you add items so it is always as long as the number of items contained in it. You do not have to manage the size of the ArrayList yourself! How wonderful!
