title: Topic 4 - Conditional blocks
date: 16/10/18

In the past lectures, we discussed how we could use _for loops_ and _while loops_ to handle repetitive tasks. However, that is only useful if we want to repeat exactly the same task every time. Similarly, the programs we've discussed are fairly linear, in the sense that there is no conditional element to the way we process data. This is where _conditional blocks_ come into play.
