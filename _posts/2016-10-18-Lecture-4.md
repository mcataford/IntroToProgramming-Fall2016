title: Topic 4 - Conditional blocks
date: 16/10/18

In the past lectures, we discussed how we could use _for loops_ and _while loops_ to handle repetitive tasks. However, that is only useful if we want to repeat exactly the same task every time. Similarly, the programs we've discussed are fairly linear, in the sense that there is no conditional element to the way we process data. This is where _conditional blocks_ come into play.

Conditional blocks are structures that will allow you to execute code based on _conditions_. In its most basic form, a conditional block looks like this:

```java
if(condition) {
  //Code to execute if the condition is true.
} else {
  //Code to execute otherwise.
}
```

In this case, whatever we put inside of the `if` segment will be executed _if and only if_ the condition(s) in the parentheses are _true_, otherwise, the `else` segment will be executed.
