title: Problem set 3
date: 16/11/9

Given our newfound knowledge of _objects_ and _object-oriented programming_, we can revisit some old problems we've worked on in the previous set and improve them. We can also build cool abstractions for real-life things. When working on problems of this set, I recommend having a piece of paper nearby to _design_ your objects and their instance variables and methods, as well as _how they interact together_ if one object contains another.

### Short exercises

Before we get into the longer coding tasks, let's jog our memory with a few short questions about terminology. If at any point you are uncertain of what a term means, you should go back to the class notes, or use Google, to make sure you understand fully what each of these words refers to. We'll be using them profusely in the longer exercises and in class.

1. What is an object?

2. What is a reference variable? How is it different from a primitive variable?

3. What is an instance variable? What is an instance method? Are they declared differently than their non-object counterparts? (Think of the _keywords_ we use to define them)

4. What is a constructor? Why is it necessary, and how is it different from other instance methods?

5. Once you have designed and implemented your object(s), how do you use them? How do you create a variable using your object?

### Longer exercises

1. Our first longer exercise will have us design a _phone book_, something we've already worked on in the past before knowing about objects, and in class while learning about them.
