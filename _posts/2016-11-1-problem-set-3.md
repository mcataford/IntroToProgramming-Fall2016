title: Problem set 3

Given our newfound knowledge of _objects_ and _object-oriented programming_, we can revisit some old problems we've worked on in the previous set and improve them. We can also build cool abstractions for real-life things. When working on problems of this set, I recommend having a piece of paper nearby to _design_ your objects and their instance variables and methods, as well as _how they interact together_ if one object contains another.
