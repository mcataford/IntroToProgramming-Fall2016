In the [first lecture](www.marccataford.xyz/IntroToProgramming-Fall2016/lecture-1), we've seen our first program, 
the __Hello world__ program. As we said, the _general canvas_ of that program, namely the _class_ and the _main method_, will 
remain the same for the next few programs we will write. 

Your first exercise is to rewrite the __Hello world__ program without looking at the lecture document. Of course, if you are stuck,
you should _absolutely_ look back and refresh your memory before you do this.

## Exercises

1. Rewrite the __Hello world__ program from the first lecture. You should be able to compile and run it using Eclipse. If you need a refresher, the whole procedure is outlined in the last sections of Lecture 1.
2. As you might have noticed, everything that is inside of the parentheses of the `System.out.println` command's parentheses is printed to the screen. Try replacing the current message with your name, or with any other message and rerun the program.
3. You can copy/paste the `System.out.println` command and print a few more lines at the same time. Experiment a bit with it, we'll get into it further next lecture.
