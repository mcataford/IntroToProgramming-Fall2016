This is where you'll find problem sets that you can use to practice what we've seen in class, and to hone your coding skills! _Model answers_ will be posted roughly a week after each problem set is up to give you time to produce your own answers.

_No problem sets are available right now, you'll receive email updates when new ones come up!_
