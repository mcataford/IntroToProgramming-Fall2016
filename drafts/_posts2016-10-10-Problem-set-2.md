# Problem set 2
## Playing with variables and loops

## Variables

In Lecture 2, we talked about the different types of variables you can use and how to create variables, through _declaration_ and _initialization_, to store and use data. We also saw that we can use _arithmetic operators_ to add, subtract, multiply and divide numbers together, and the _concatenation operator_ (+) to 'paste' Strings and other variables together into bigger Strings. Let's explore this further!

To get used to Eclipse, I recommend that you create a __new Java project__ for this problem set, and a __new Class file__ for each problem is contains. This will ensure that you repeat and learn the basic program canvas that we discussed in Lecture 1, as we'll be using it throughout the semester. If you aren't sure of how to do this, revisit Lecture 1, where we described how to get set up and run _Hello, world_.

### Warm-up exercises

__Before we jump into larger exercises, let's warm up a bit and use the concepts we've learned in [Variables and arrays](http://www.marccataford.xyz/IntroToProgramming-Fall2016/Lecture-2/) and [Loops and conditional statements](http://www.marccataford.xyz/IntroToProgramming-Fall2016/Lecture-3/). If you are unsure of how to solve one of these small problems, go back to the material to make sure you have a fair understanding of the building blocks at your disposal.__

_Note: for each of these exercises, create a new Class file so that you can practice the repetitive parts of setting up a Java file (the class and the main method)._

1. First, we will play with variable declaration. Declare a few variables of types `double`, `int`, `String`, `char` and `boolean` and initialize them with values corresponding to their type. Print those variables using the `System.out.println` method. As we've seen when we discussed types, we saw that `double` allows for fractional numbers, while `int` is limited to integers. What happens if you assign an integer to a
