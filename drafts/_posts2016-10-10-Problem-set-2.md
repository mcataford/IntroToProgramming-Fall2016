# Problem set 2
## Playing with variables and loops

## Variables

In Lecture 2, we talked about the different types of variables you can use and how to create variables, through _declaration_ and _initialization_, to store and use data. We also saw that we can use _arithmetic operators_ to add, subtract, multiply and divide numbers together, and the _concatenation operator_ (+) to 'paste' Strings and other variables together into bigger Strings. Let's explore this further!

To get used to Eclipse, I recommend that you create a __new Java project__ for this problem set, and a __new Class file__ for each problem is contains. This will ensure that you repeat and learn the basic program canvas that we discussed in Lecture 1, as we'll be using it throughout the semester. If you aren't sure of how to do this, revisit Lecture 1, where we described how to get set up and run _Hello, world_.

### Warm-up exercises

__Before we jump into larger exercises, let's warm up a bit and use the concepts we've learned in [Variables and arrays](http://www.marccataford.xyz/IntroToProgramming-Fall2016/Lecture-2/) and [Loops and conditional statements](http://www.marccataford.xyz/IntroToProgramming-Fall2016/Lecture-3/). If you are unsure of how to solve one of these small problems, go back to the material to make sure you have a fair understanding of the building blocks at your disposal.__

_Note: Feel free to complete these exercises in a single Class file._

First, let's play with variable and array declaration:

1. Declare and initialize one `int`, one `double`, one `char`, one `boolean` and one `String`. The initial value of those variables should be appropriate to the type. Once they are all initialized, print each variable using `System.out.println`.
2. Try assigning an integer to a `double` variable using '='. If you print the variable, what do you notice? (Is it still an integer?)
3. Try the inverse: assigning a fractional number such as 0.5 to an `int` variable. Is your program allowed to run? What is the error that comes up, if any?
4. Declare an `int` array of length 10 and initialize it using an _array literal_. Print the elements of your array one at a time using _indices_. Remember, you can access the elements of an array _myArray_ by writing _myArray[i]_ where i is a value between 0 and the length of the array minus one.
5. Reinitialize the array as an empty array (using _new type[length]_ as we've seen in class): what happens if you print out the elements of the array again?
